# eswarjakkula.github.io
 This project demonstrates how to deploy a static website for free using GitHub Pages. First, create a GitHub repository named <eswarjakkula>.github.io and clone it locally using Git CLI or GitHub Desktop. Copy your static website files, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, into the cloned repository folder. Commit the changes and push them to GitHub. In the repository settings, enable GitHub Pages by selecting the main branch and root folder as the source. After a few minutes, the website will be live at https://<eswarjakkula>.github.io. Any updates can be deployed by committing and pushing new changes. This workflow helps understand version control, static hosting, and deployment, making it ideal for building portfolios, demos, or small projects.
